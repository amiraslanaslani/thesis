	18-93 years, 18 females (average age 65 years, range 18-93) and
	13 males (average age 57 years, range 19-87). The cells were
	differentiated in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia and
	neurons and counting were done in each of the four lobes. The
	study showed that the different subpopulations of glial cells
	behave differently as a function of age; the number of
	oligodendrocytes showed a significant 27\% decrease over adult
	life and a strong correlation to the total number of neurons
	while the total astrocyte number is constant through life;
	finally males have a 28\% higher number of neocortical glial
	cells and a 19\% higher neocortical neuron number than females.
	The overall total number of neocortical neurons and glial cells
	was 49.3 billion in females and 65.2 billion in males, a
	difference of 24\% with a high biological variance. These
	numbers can serve as reference values in quantitative studies of

	abstract = {In perceiving objects we may synthesize conjunctions of separable features by directing attention serially to each item in turn (A. Treisman and G. Gelade, Cognitive Psychology, 1980, 12, 97–136). This feature-integration theory predicts that when attention is diverted or overloaded, features may be wrongly recombined, giving rise to “illusory conjunctions.” The present paper confirms that illusory conjunctions are frequently experienced among unattended stimuli varying in color and shape, and that they occur also with size and solidity (outlined versus filled-in shapes). They are shown both in verbal recall and in simultaneous and successive matching tasks, making it unlikely that they depend on verbal labeling or on memory failure. They occur as often between stimuli differing on many features as between more similar stimuli, and spatial separation has little effect on their frequency. Each feature seems to be coded as an independent entity and to migrate, when attention is diverted, with few constraints from the other features of its source or destination.}

	abstract="Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are based on highly simplified brain dynamics and have been used as powerful computational tools to solve complex pattern recognition, function estimation, and classification problems. Throughout their development, ANNs have been evolving towards more powerful and more biologically realistic models. In the last decade, the third generation Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been developed which comprise of spiking neurons. Information transfer in these neurons models the information transfer in biological neurons, i.e., via the precise timing of spikes or a sequence of spikes. Addition of the temporal dimension for information encoding in SNNs yields new insight into the dynamics of the human brain and has the potential to result in compact representations of large neural networks. As such, SNNs have great potential for solving complicated time-dependent pattern recognition problems defined by time series because of their inherent dynamic representation. This article presents an overview of the development of spiking neurons and SNNs within the context of feedforward networks, and provides insight into their potential for becoming the next generation neural networks.",

In particular it is shown that networks of spiking neurons are, with regard to the number of neurons that are needed, computationally more powerful than these other neural network models. A concrete biologically relevant function is exhibited which can be computed by a single spiking neuron (for biologically reasonable values of its parameters), but which requires hundreds of hidden units on a sigmoidal neural net. On the other hand, it is known that any function that can be computed by a small sigmoidal neural net can also be computed by a small network of spiking neurons. This article does not assume prior knowledge about spiking neurons, and it contains an extensive list of references to the currently available literature on computations in networks of spiking neurons and relevant results from neurobiology."
